# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2, where we explore digital twin environments for robotics simulation. This module focuses on combining Gazebo for physics simulation with Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction. You'll learn to create realistic simulated environments for humanoid robots and understand how to integrate simulated sensors.

**Target Audience:** AI and robotics students working with simulated humanoids

**Module Duration:** 4-6 weeks (depending on pace)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments with accurate physics
2. Configure gravity, collision properties, and dynamics for realistic simulation
3. Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2 for robot control and sensor data
4. Build high-fidelity rendering environments using Unity
5. Implement human-robot interaction interfaces in Unity
6. Configure and utilize simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
7. Validate simulation accuracy against real-world robot behavior

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of 3D modeling and physics concepts
- Programming experience in Python and/or C#

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation**
   - Gazebo basics and environment setup
   - Physics engines and parameters
   - Gravity and collision modeling
   - ROS 2 integration

2. **Chapter 2: Unity Integration for High-Fidelity Rendering**
