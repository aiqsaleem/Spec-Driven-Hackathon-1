# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the ROS 2 Fundamentals for Humanoid Robotics course! This module focuses on foundational middleware concepts for controlling humanoid robots using ROS 2.

## Module Overview

In this module, you will learn how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" connecting AI agents to physical robot bodies. We'll cover the core communication patterns, Python integration, and robot modeling that form the foundation of humanoid robotics development.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand and implement ROS 2 communication fundamentals (nodes, topics, services, and actions)
- Connect Python-based AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Model robot bodies using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Explain the ROS 2 communication model and DDS (Data Distribution Service)

### Module Structure

This module is organized into three progressive chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Communication Fundamentals** - Learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. **Chapter 2: Python Agents to Robot Control** - Using rclpy to write ROS 2 nodes and bridging AI agents to controllers
3. **Chapter 3: Robot Body Representation (URDF)** - URDF structure and components for humanoid joints, links, and sensors

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 enables the communication between AI algorithms and physical robot bodies.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

### Estimated Duration

This module should take approximately 3 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with robotics and middleware systems.

Let's begin exploring how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots!
