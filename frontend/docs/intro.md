# Introduction to ROS 2 Fundamentals for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the ROS 2 Fundamentals for Humanoid Robotics course! This comprehensive course is designed for AI and software engineering students transitioning into humanoid robotics.

## Course Overview

This course teaches you how to use ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the "nervous system" connecting AI agents to physical robot bodies. You'll learn the foundational middleware concepts necessary for controlling humanoid robots using ROS 2.

### What You'll Learn

In this course, you will:

- Master ROS 2 communication fundamentals (nodes, topics, services, and actions)
- Bridge Python-based AI agents to ROS controllers
- Model robot bodies using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Connect URDF models to ROS 2 control pipelines
- Work with ROS 2's communication model and DDS (Data Distribution Service)
- Use ROS 2 CLI tools effectively and understand workspace structure

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

### Course Structure

The course is organized into modules, with Module 1 covering ROS 2 fundamentals:

- **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Communication Fundamentals
- **Chapter 2**: Python Agents to Robot Control
- **Chapter 3**: Robot Body Representation (URDF)

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this course:

1. Work through each chapter in sequence
2. Complete the hands-on exercises
3. Practice with the provided code examples
4. Refer to the official ROS 2 documentation for additional details

Let's begin your journey into humanoid robotics with ROS 2!
