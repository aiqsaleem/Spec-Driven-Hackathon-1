# Module 2 Digital Twin Specification Created

## Summary of Work
Created a comprehensive specification package for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), designed for AI and robotics students working with simulated humanoid robots.

## Documents Created

### 1. Specification Document (spec.md)
- Overview of the digital twin environment combining Gazebo and Unity
- Learning objectives for students
- Chapter breakdown with learning goals, topics, activities, and acceptance criteria
- Technical requirements and system dependencies
- Assessment methods and timeline

### 2. Implementation Plan (plan.md)
- System architecture overview with components and technology stack
- Four-phase implementation approach (Gazebo setup, Unity environment, sensor simulation, integration)
- Technical considerations and risk assessment
- Quality assurance and deployment strategy

### 3. Detailed Tasks (tasks.md)
- Comprehensive task breakdown for all four phases
- Specific objectives and checklists for each component
- Performance optimization and user experience enhancement tasks

## Target Audience
AI and robotics students working with simulated humanoid robots, focusing on physics simulation and digital twin environments across three main areas:
1. Gazebo physics, gravity, collisions, and ROS 2 integration
2. Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction
3. Simulated sensors: LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs

## Outcome
The specification package provides a complete roadmap for implementing a digital twin environment that combines Gazebo's physics simulation capabilities with Unity's high-fidelity rendering for educational purposes.
